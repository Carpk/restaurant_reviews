## Chicago LunchBox

While name may be temporary, Chicago LunchBox is a personal restaurant review site. Current plans are to use Authlogic for user authentication, and Geocoder for map manipulation.

While still in development, [Chicago Lunchbox](https://chicagolunchbox.herokuapp.com/) is being hosted on Heroku.
